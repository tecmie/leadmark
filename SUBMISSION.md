## What I Built

**LeadMark** is an AI-powered lead qualification engine that automatically ingests inbound email, SMS, and WhatsApp messages via Postmark Dev Inbox and applies your custom qualification rules to each message. Low-quality leads receive an auto-reply deferment, while high-value leads are instantly routed to your CRM or Slack‚Äîsaving you hours of manual work every day.
