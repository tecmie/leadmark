### 2. Email Processing Demo (60 seconds)

**Sample Email:**
```
Subject: Web Development Inquiry

Hi, I run a small bakery and need a website to showcase 
our products and allow online ordering. What's your 
process and how much would this cost?
```

**Expected AI Response** (within 10 seconds):
```
Hi there!

Thanks for reaching out about web development for your bakery! 
I'd love to help you create a beautiful online presence.

For bakery websites with online ordering, I typically recommend:
- Showcase gallery for your products
- Online ordering system with payment processing
- Customer reviews and testimonials
- Store location and hours
- Mobile-responsive design

The process usually takes 4-6 weeks and includes design, 
development, and training. For a project like yours, 
investment typically ranges from $3,000-$8,000 depending 
on specific features.

I'd love to discuss your vision in more detail. Are you 
available for a 30-minute consultation this week?

Best regards,
[Demo Assistant]
```

**Send another email:**
```
Subject: Schedule a Call

That sounds perfect! Can we schedule a call to discuss 
this further? I'm available most afternoons this week.

**Expected AI Response:**
```
Absolutely! I've checked my calendar and have these times available:

â€¢ Tuesday, June 4th at 2:00 PM EST
â€¢ Wednesday, June 5th at 10:00 AM EST
