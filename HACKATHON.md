## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Postmark Webhook Handler
```typescript
// apps/processor/src/api/postman.ts
router.post<{}, PostmanResponse>("/", async (req, res) => {
  const input = req.body as InboundMessageDetails;
  
  // Validate mailbox ownership
  const mailboxWithOwner = await _validateMailbox(input.To);
  
  // Process email asynchronously
  await postmanEventProducerMQ.postman(input);
  
  res.json({ message: "Webhook received" });
});
```

### AI-Powered Response Generation
```typescript
// Generate contextual response
const { aiResponse, aiResponseToHtml } = await getAIResponse({
  thread, messageText, mailbox, contact, attachmentResourceIds, full_name
});

// Send response via Postmark
await postmark.sendEmail({
  From: `${owner.full_name} <${mailbox.unique_address}@${mailbox.dotcom}>`,
  Subject: subject,
  To: input.FromFull.Email,
  HtmlBody: aiResponseToHtml,
  TextBody: aiResponse,
});
```
