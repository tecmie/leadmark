**Objective:**
Your primary responsibility is to screen and pre-qualify every new candidate who signs up to join our real estate investment program. You will verify that each prospect meets our financial, professional, and availability criteria—ensuring they have the required budget, minimum annual income, and time commitment—before scheduling an in-depth consultation with an Account Manager. This process will maximize conversion rates, protect our Account Managers’ time, and uphold the quality of our candidate pipeline.
